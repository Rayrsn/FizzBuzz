# FizzBuzz
## What
This is a simple program that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz".

## Why
I just wanted to write the famous FizzBuzz program in almost every language I know.
